# oo.js unit tests, performance tests, and demos

ootest.js is a small unit testing framework.  There's nothing oo.js-specific about it, if you want to try using it for your own testing purposes, but there are plenty of other libraries out there that do this sort of thing.

Anyhow, the "test\_*" files here are tests of the oo.js library.

The "demo\_*" files here are functioning demos illustrating how oo.js can be used.

The "performance\_*" files here are performance tests I've written.  Some of these test oo.js performance, some test various coding patterns that are used in oo.js and other libraries for comparison purposes.
